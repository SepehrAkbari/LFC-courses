# CSCI 240: Computational Mathematics

#### Course Description:
This course provides a survey of computational techniques and methods that are rooted in mathematics and computing. Topics covered include numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations, non-linear equations in one variable, and classification methods. Applications of the techniques to "real-life" problems encountered in economics, physics, and/or the life sciences is emphasized. Constructing computer programs to implement the techniques presented also is emphasized.
