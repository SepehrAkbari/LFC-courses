```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

View the `msleep` set as a random sample of mammals. Is rem sleep amount related to diet (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, etc)?

Null: the mean of `sleep_total` is the same for all `vore`.

Alternative: the mean isn't the same for all `vore`.

```{r}
ggplot(
  msleep,
  aes(y = vore,
      x = sleep_total)
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

(I should look at the NA's)

```{r}
model <- aov(sleep_total ~ vore, data = msleep)
summary(model)
```

The p-value isn't very small. There is a 9.1% chance of data like this happening at random when the null is true. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that `sleep_total` is dependent on `vore`.

Can we say anything about pairwise comparisons?

```{r}
TukeyHSD(model)
```
