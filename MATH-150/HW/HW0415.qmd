**Answer:**

(a) Positive Strong

(b) Positive Weak

(c) The Husband's age scatterplot as they are closer and therefore illustrate a more collerated data

# Introducing linear regression

## Problem 1

![](images/Screenshot%202024-04-15%20at%2010.13.30.png){fig-align="center"}

**Answer:**

(a) Explanatory Variable is the Husband's Age, and the Response Variable is the Wife's Age.

(b) The relationship is strong positive

(c)

(d) About maybe $70%$. Could have been more.

(e) For this we need to calculate the points and slope:

$$
p1: (20,21)
$$

$$
p2: (40,30)
$$

$$
m = \frac{\Delta p1}{\Delta p2} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9
$$

$$
y = 0.9x+39
$$

## Problem 2

![](images/Screenshot%202024-04-15%20at%2010.10.47.png){fig-align="center"}

**Answer:**

(a) Explanatory Variable is the Family Income, and the Response Variable is the Gift Aid from University.

(b) About $-0.30$. It is weak negative, and has very little correlation.

(c) For this we need to calculate the points and slope:

$$
p1: (20000,20000)
$$

$$
p2: (98000,10000)
$$

$$
m = \frac{\Delta p1}{\Delta p2} = -\frac{10000}{88000} = -0.11
$$

$$
y = -0.11x + 21.1
$$
