# Problem 1

Suppose X has a normal distribution with mean 24 and standard deviation 5.

(a) Sketch the distribution. Label at least 5 points on the x-axis.

(b) Fill in the blank: $P(24-5< X < 24+5) = 68\%$. Use the emperical rule.

(c) Fill in the blank: $P(24-(5 \times 2)< X < 24+(5 \times 2)) = 95\%$. Use the emperical rule.

(d) Fill in the blank: $P(24-(5 \times 3)< X < 24+(5 \times 3)) = 99.7\%$. Use the emperical rule.

(e) Sketch $P(X \le 28)$.

(f) Compute P(X ≤ 28). Include both R code and a numerical answer.

```{r}
pnorm(28,24,5)
```


(g) Compute P (X > 26). Include both R code and a numerical answer.

```{r}
1 - pnorm(26,24,5)
```


(h) Compute P (26 ≤ X ≤ 28). Include both R code and a numerical answer.

```{r}
pnorm(28,24,5) - pnorm(26,24,5)
```
