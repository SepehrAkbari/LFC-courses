# Hypothesis testing: errors

## Instructions

For each of the following problems,

(a) State null and alternative hypotheses appropriate to the situation

(b) Describe what a type I and type II error would look like.

## Problem 1

A smart phone manufacturer claims that their devices have a mean charge time of $35$ minutes. A consumer group suspects itâ€™s longer. They collect a sample of size $89$ to test the claim.

**Answer:**

***(a) Null & Alternative Hypotheses***

**Null Hypotheses** $(H_0)$**:** The average charging time for the manufacturer's smartphones is $35$ minutes. (This is the manufacturer's claim)

**Alternative Hypotheses** $(H_1)$**:** The average charging time for the manufacturer's smartphones is different from $35$ minutes. (This is what the consumer group suspects)

***(b) Type I & Type II Errors***

**Type I Error:** We reject the null hypothesis $(H_0)$ when it's actually true. In this case, we would conclude that the average charging time is different from 35 minutes, when in reality it actually is $35$ minutes on average.

**Type II Error:** We accept the null hypothesis $(H_0)$ when it's actually false. Here, we would conclude that the average charging time is $35$ minutes, when it's actually longer or shorter than that.

## Problem 2

The NBA advertises that the average length of their games is $131$ minutes. A fan times $25$ games to see if this claim is reasonable.

**Answer:**

***(a) Null & Alternative Hypotheses***

**Null Hypotheses** $(H_0)$**:** The average length of NBA games is $131$ minutes. (This is the NBA's advertised claim)

**Alternative Hypotheses** $(H_1)$**:** The average length of NBA games is different from $131$ minutes. (The fan suspects games are either longer or shorter)

***(b) Type I & Type II Errors***

**Type I Error:** We reject the null hypothesis $(H_0)$ when it's actually true. In this case, we would conclude that the average game length is different from $131$ minutes, when all games are actually $131$ minutes long on average.

**Type II Error:** We fail to reject the null hypothesis $(H_0)$ when it's actually false. Here, we would conclude that the average game length is $131$ minutes, when games are actually longer or shorter than that on average.
