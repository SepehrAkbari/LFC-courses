## Problem 6

The lengths of a certain breed of cat are normally-distributed with mean $62$ cm and standard deviation $5$ cm.

(a) What is the probability that a randomly-selected cat is at least $60$ cm long? Give both R code and output.

**Answer:**

```{r}
1 - pnorm(60, 62, 5)
```

The probability of a randomly-selected cat is at least $60$ cm long is about $66\%$.

(b) The graph below shows this distribution. Do not assume that it is drawn exactly to scale.

The shaded area is symmetric about the mean, has area $0.90$, and ends at $±x$. What is $x$? Carefully explain your process.

**Answer:**

Essentially, we are trying to find the Z-Score corresponding with $x$. Therefore we need to use R's $qnorm$ function.

However, the percentile given in $qnorm(x,\mu,\sigma)$ has to be everything to the left of x, which could be calculated so:

$$ 0.9 + \frac{1 - 0.9}{2} = 0.95 $$ With knowing the area under the curve to the left of $x$, we can then find $x$ using R:

```{r}
qnorm(0.95, 62, 5)
```

which is about $70.2$.

## Problem 7

A study asks a random sample of Americans how many cups of co↵ee they drink on a typical weekday. The results are summarized in the following histogram, where the vertical axis represents proportions of respondents.

![](images/Screenshot%202024-03-07%20at%2002.09.34.png){fig-align="center" width="544"}

(a) What is the probability that a randomly-selected person drinks at least $2$ cups of coffee per day?

**Answer:**

To find the probability of a random person drinking **at least** $2$ cups is:

$$ P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) $$

Which is:

$$ 0.18 + 0.09 + 0.07 + 0.02 = 0.36$$

So the probability is $36\%$.

(b) Let $X$ be a random variable representing the number of cups reported by a randomly-selected individual in the sample. Use R to compute the expected value of $X$. Include all code used, making sure that your work is clear.

**Answer:**

```{r}
no_cups <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
p_cups <- c(0.37,0.27,0.18,0.09,0.07,0.02)

m <- sum(p_cups * no_cups)

m
```

Therefore, the expected value of $X$ is $1.28$

(c) Use R to compute the variance and standard deviation of $X$. Include all code used, making sure that your work is clear.

**Answer:**

```{r}
no_cups <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
p_cups <- c(0.37,0.27,0.18,0.09,0.07,0.02)

m <- sum(p_cups * no_cups)

variance <- sum((no_cups - m) ^ 2 * p_cups)
variance
```

The variance of $X$ is about $1.78$.

```{r}
no_cups <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
p_cups <- c(0.37,0.27,0.18,0.09,0.07,0.02)

m <- sum(p_cups * no_cups)

std <- sqrt(sum((no_cups - m) ^ 2 * p_cups))
std
```

The standard deviation of $X$ is about $1.33$.
