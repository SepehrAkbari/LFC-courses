            <p>
                I am currently a freshman at Lake Forest College, studying computer science, and minoring in Math and Digital Media Design. I am originally from Iran, but have lived in different countries all my life. I have always not only been passionate about computer science and the amazing things that can be done with it, but also the user experience of those products, which took me to UX and digital design.

                I am mostly a self-taught designer, however in Lake Forest College my skills grew as I took classes and collaborated with other creative artists. This portfolio is a collection of my work, which hopefully reflects my thinking behind my artwork and will help you to get to know me personaly.
