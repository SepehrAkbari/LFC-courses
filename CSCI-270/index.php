<h3>DMD Minor</h3>

    <p>I believe the combination of my majors and minor allows me to merge my passion for technology with a creative edge, aiming to bridge the realms of code and art. The DMD program gives me a new perspective of front-end development, and with delving into UX/UI topics, makes a, not better programmer, but developer out of me.</p>
