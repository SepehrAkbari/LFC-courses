**Constraints**

- Foreign key relationships must be enforced, such as ensuring that prescriptions only reference existing doctors, patients, and drugs.

- When a pharmaceutical company is deleted, its products (drugs) should also be deleted.

- If the same doctor prescribes the same drug for the same patient multiple times, only the last prescription is stored. We have to keep track of the date of the prescription to determine which one is the last.

#### Part 2:

Then we just have to remove the drugPrice table, and instead add a price attribute to the drug table.

#### Part 3:

By adding a primary key, in this case I added a prescriptionID, we can now store multiple prescriptions for the same doctor, patient, and drug. Date will not serve the same purpose as before, but we can still keep track of it.
