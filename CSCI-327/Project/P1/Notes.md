Set Up the Database (SQL):

    Create tables for Store, Member, Movie, Copy, Player, Rental, and Reservation.
    Define relationships (foreign keys) and constraints (e.g., rental limits, return policies).
    Populate the database with sample data for testing.

Establish PHP-Database Connection:

    Use PDO or MySQLi to connect PHP to the SQL database.
    Create a central db_connect.php file for reusable connections.

Build Core Features (PHP):

    Member Management: Register, view, and edit members.
    Movie & Player Inventory: List, add, edit, and delete movies and players.
    Rental & Return System:
    Rent up to 10 movies and 1 player.
    Return movies to any store, players to the original store.
    Apply a 10% discount for weekday rentals.
    Reservations: Allow members to reserve titles online.

Create a Menu-Driven UI (PHP/HTML/CSS):

    Main menu for navigation: Members | Movies | Rentals | Reservations | Reports
    Forms for adding/editing data and buttons for rental/return actions.

Implement Business Logic:

    Enforce rental limits and return policies.
    Calculate rental charges and apply discounts automatically.

Testing:

    Verify all features (rentals, returns, reservations) work as intended.
    Test database interactions and edge cases (e.g., rental limits).

Finalize & Debug:

    Fix any bugs, optimize code, and clean up the UI.
    Ensure the entire system functions smoothly end-to-end.
