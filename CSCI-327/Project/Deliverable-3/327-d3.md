### **Difficulties**

1. Database Design:

    - Making sure foreign keys were not duplicated or interfering with each other.
    - We also realized that checking for some of the requirements especially when it came to dates in the SQL is simpler than in PHP.
    - Excitedly, we tried normalizing the database when we learned about it, but it was too late for us...

2. Functionalities (PHP):

    - Counting the current date as the present date and not in the past.
    - Validating that unique keys were not duplicated without causing an SQL error.
    - Having the reserved items be checkout normally.
    - Making sure the user could not return a player to a different store than the one they rented it from.
    - Making sure the user could not return a movie or player at a checkout time in the past.
    - Making sure the user could not rent more than 1 player at a time.
    - Having items count reduced from items table when rented.
    - Getting the reports to show up exactly correct. Our database design was not the most simple, and writing correct SQL queries was a bit tricky.

3. User Interface (HTML/CSS):

    - Adding a User View to the admin's dashboard.
    - Making editing a movie or player smoother without redirecting to a new page.
