## CSCI 327 â€“ Project: Deliverable 3

---

In this project, me and Ilana (my only group partner) first together created the database schema, we iteratively modified it as we ran into issues creating the application. 

Next, I was in charge of writing almost all the PHP code and the basic HTML design. Once the functionalities were implemented, Ilana enhanced the HTML, did all the styling with CSS, and modified some of the PHP code to adjust functionalities to the design.

After all this was done, we both worked together again to add some final touches mainly in the PHP code to make sure all the project requirements and our own requirements were met.
