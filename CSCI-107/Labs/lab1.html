        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating web pages
            and structuring their content on the internet. It employs a system of markup tags enclosed 
            in angle brackets (< >) to define various elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and more. 
            These tags indicate how content should be displayed and organized on a web page.

        <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <p>
            A web server is a computer or software that stores and serves websites to users when they request them.
            It handles user requests, retrieves web pages, and sends them to browsers, 
            making websites accessible on the internet.

        <h3>ARPANET</h3>
        <p>
            ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network) was the early predecessor of the internet, 
            developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s. 
            It was the first network to use the principles of the modern internet, 
            allowing computers to share information over long distances.

        <h3>WWW</h3>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly referred to as the web, is a system of interconnected documents 
            and resources linked through hyperlinks. It's a part of the internet that allows users to access 
            and share multimedia content, including text, images, videos, and more, using web browsers. 
            Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989, 
            and it has since become a fundamental component of the internet.

        <h3>Domain Name</h3>
        <p>
            A domain name is a human-readable web address that serves as a user-friendly way to locate websites 
            or resources on the internet, such as <a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">www.example.com</a>. 
            It's used to identify and access specific locations on the web instead of relying on numerical IP addresses.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <p>
            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol that enables web browsers to request 
            and receive web content from servers, making it the backbone of the World Wide Web.
        </p>

        <h3>W3C</h3>
        <p>
            W3C, or the World Wide Web Consortium, is an organization that develops and maintains web standards 
            and guidelines to ensure consistency and compatibility in web technologies, 
            making the web work smoothly across different browsers and platforms. 
            It was also responsible for creating a uniform version of HTML, and ending the browser wars.
        </p>

        <h3>URL</h3>
        <p>
            A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is a web address that specifies the location of a resource 
            on the internet. It consists of various components, including the protocol 
            (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), the domain name 
            (e.g., <a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">"www.example.com"</a>), 
            and a path or query that identifies the specific resource (e.g., "/specific_page").
