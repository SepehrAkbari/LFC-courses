### Fields

A field is a set $F$ with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying certain axioms.

Key Properties:

A field $F$ must satisfy:

1. Closure under addition and multiplication:

$$
a,b \in \mathbb{F} \text{ then } a+b\in \mathbb{F}
$$

$$
a,b \in \mathbb{F} \text{ then } a \times b\in \mathbb{F}
$$

2. Associativity:

$$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) $$

$$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$$

5. Commutativity:

$$a + b = b + a $$

$$ a \cdot b = b \cdot a$$

8. Identity Elements:

- Additive identity:
  
$$a + 0 = a, \forall a \in \mathbb{F}$$

- Multiplicative identity:

$$a \times 1 = a, \forall a \in \mathbb{F}$$

5. Inverses:

- Additive inverse:

$$a + (-a) = 0, \forall a \in \mathbb{F}$$

- Multiplicative inverse:

$$a (a^{-1}) = 1, \forall a \in \mathbb{F}$$

6. Distributivity:

$$a\cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$$
   
Common Examples of Fields: $$\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{Z}_{p \text{ (where p is prime)}}, \mathbb{F}^\infty$$

To prove a set F is a field:

- Verify closure under addition and multiplication.

- Show all field axioms hold (especially existence of identities and inverses).
