## Necessary Features

**Morphological Features:**

- Area, Perimeter: Basic size measurements of the cell/nucleus.
- Circularity/Aspect Ratio: To capture the shape and symmetry.
- Solidity: Measures the density or “fullness” of the cell shape.

**Texture Features:**

- Local Binary Patterns (LBP): Captures local texture differences.
- Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) Features: Such as contrast, homogeneity, energy, and correlation.

**Color Features:**

- Color Histograms: In RGB or converted color spaces (e.g., HSV) to capture staining differences.
- Color Moments: Mean, variance, and skewness of the color channels.

## Optional Features

**Edge Features:**

Edge Histograms: Using operators like Sobel or Canny to capture the edge density and orientation.

**Shape Descriptors:**

- Fourier Descriptors: For capturing shape details in a frequency domain.
- Zernike Moments: For rotation-invariant shape analysis.

**Advanced Texture Features:**

Haralick Features: Derived from GLCM, often provide a richer description of texture.

**Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG):**

Can capture gradient orientation and intensity, which may help in differentiating subtle differences between cell types.
